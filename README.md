# Prototracker
Prototracker is a multiplatform fakebit chiptune tracker. [Try the online version.](http://kometbomb.net/prototracker/)

The editor is a fairly normal tracker. The synth is an absolutely minimal single-oscillator synth (with 256 preset waveforms). Macros are used to create "instruments" and also some normal channel effects. Most keyboard shortcuts are the same as in Protracker. See the docs/ directory for help.

Supported platforms:
 * HTML5 (see the link above)
 * Windows (MinGW)
 * Linux
 * Mac (just use the Linux makefile)
 * Chip8 (runs great on a PocketCHIP)
 * Probably anything SDL2 supports
