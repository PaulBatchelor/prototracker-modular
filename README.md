# Prototracker-modular

Prototracker-modular is a modular synthesizer fork of Prototracker. The idea is that the user can define his/her "sound chip" using basic modules. Each channel has its own "sound chip". Otherwise, the tracker is exactly like any Prototracker fork.

Double click on synth area to add a new module. Left click to connect inputs/outputs (right click cancels). Drag to move modules. See [MODULES.md](https://github.com/kometbomb/prototracker-modular/blob/master/MODULES.md) for basic info about modules.

## Download

See the [releases](https://github.com/kometbomb/prototracker-modular/releases) for binaries.

## Building

Simply do ```make mingw``` where "mingw" is your platform of choice. Do ```make``` to see the supported platforms.

The binary needs the files in the assets/ directory to work properly.
