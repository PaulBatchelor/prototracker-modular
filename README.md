# Prototracker-modular

Prototracker-modular is a modular synthesizer fork of Prototracker. The idea is that the user can define his/her "sound chip" using basic modules. Each channel has its own "sound chip". Otherwise, the tracker is exactly like any Prototracker fork.
 
## Building

Simply do ```make mingw``` where "mingw" is your platform of choice. Do ```make``` to see the supported platforms. 

The binary needs the files in the assets/ directory to work properly.
